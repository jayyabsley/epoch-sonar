# EpochSonar - Audio Alert Addon

A simple audio alert addon for gathering nodes in World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5).

## Current Status

**Version 2.0.0-dev** - Audio alert system with node learning functionality

## Features (In Development)

- **Audio Alerts**: Plays a sound when you get close to learned gathering nodes
- **Node Learning**: Records locations when you loot gathering nodes 
- **Simple Commands**: Basic toggle and configuration commands
- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers node locations across sessions

## Installation

1. Copy the `EpochSonar` folder to your WoW AddOns directory:
   - Windows: `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\`
   - Mac: `Applications/World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/`

2. Restart World of Warcraft or reload your UI (`/reload`)

3. Enable the addon in the AddOns menu at character selection

## Commands

- `/epochsonar` or `/es` - Enable/disable audio alerts
- `/es sound` - Toggle sound on/off  
- `/es test` - Play test sound
- `/es debug` - Show debug information (for development)
- `/es reset` - Reset all learned node data

## How It's Supposed to Work (When Complete)

1. **Learning Phase**: Target and loot gathering nodes (mining veins, herbs, etc.)
2. **Audio Alerts**: When you get close to previously learned node locations, hear an audio ping
3. **Cooldown**: Alerts have a 2-second cooldown to prevent spam

## Known Issues

- **Node detection may not work reliably**
- **Audio alerts may not trigger correctly**  
- **Learning system needs refinement**
- **Range detection requires calibration**
- **Many features are experimental**

## Technical Details

- **Interface Version**: 30300 (WotLK 3.3.5)
- **Alert Range**: 0.08 map coordinate units (experimental)

## Development Notes

This addon is being actively developed. The current approach uses:
- Event-driven node learning (LOOT_OPENED events)
- Proximity-based audio alerts
- Simple coordinate-based distance calculations


## Version History

- **v2.0.0-dev**: Complete rewrite as audio alert system (IN DEVELOPMENT)
- **v1.0.0**: Initial visual overlay version (deprecated)

## Credits

Created for the Epoch WoW community. Built specifically for WotLK 3.3.5 private servers.
